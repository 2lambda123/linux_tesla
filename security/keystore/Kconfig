	help
		An IVI system deals with various keys that need to be stored
		securely on the platform. Some of the keys are stored in
		specific embedded hardware but others are required by
		algorithms running on Linux. The keystore is designed to
		provide a secure storage solution for such keys. Applications
		interface is through the char device ioctls on /dev/keystore.

		If in doubt, say "N".

		This option will create a keystore kernel module which deletes
		the user and device SEED values provided by the bootloader and
		exits. No normal keystore functionality is available.

		This option should be seleted when building an Emergency Linux
		kernel (ELK) or recovery image on a system which also uses
		keystore on the production (normal) image. This will prevent
		the SEED values being leaked on booting to the recovery image.
