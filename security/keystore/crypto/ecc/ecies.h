/********************************************************************************
 * Hybrid Key Transport via Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES)

 * Minimal implementation based on SECG SEC1 ECIES v2

/*
 * General Comments
 *
 * 1) ECIES was specified by ANSI, IEEE, ISO and SECG. The specs are mostly
 *    incompatible due to not supporting similar ciphermodes and MACs. Apart
 *    from that, the general scheme seems mostly compatible [SPECS].
 *
 *    One particular deviation between SEC1 and other ECIES standards is the
 *    optional use of SharedInfo1 and SharedInfo2 for KDF and MAC. We use
 *    SharedInfo1=R and empty SharedInfo2={} to improve compatiblity [see (3)].
 *
 * 2) We should be using HMAC-SHA2-512-512 for authenticating a 256-bit
 *    encryption. But in this particular case our encryption oracle does not
 *    accept adversary plaintext. So we don't actually need collision-resistance
 *    and will work with SHA-256 for now...right?
 *
 * 3) Interoperability with generic protocol in SECG SEC1:
 *    - Negotiate { KDF } = { HMAC-SHA2-256 }
 *    - Negotiate { ENC, MAC } = { XOR, HMAC-SHA2-256-256 }
 *    - Negotiate { SharedInfo1, SharedInfo2 } = { R,  }
 *    - EC domain parameters { T } = { secp521r1 } (determined by ecc/ecc.h)
 *    - DH without co-factor (or cofactor=1) and no point compression
 *    - Outputs still need encoding with ASN.1 or so..
 *
 * 4) Basic Algorithm is ElGamal:
 *   - Input: Message msg and receiver's public key pubKey
 *   - Generate random ephemeral EC key pair (k, R)
 *   - Generate DH shared secret z = ECDH(k, pubKey)
 *   - Generate session keys (K1||K2) = KDF(octets(z), R)
 *   - Encrypt the message as cipher = ENC(K1, msg)
 *   - MAC the ciphertext as mac = MAC(K2, cipher)
 *   - Output { R, cipher, mac }
 *
